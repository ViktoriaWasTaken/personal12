  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a simple website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <button onclick="changeText()">Click me!</button>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
    // Add some interactivity using JavaScript
    function changeText() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
This website has a simple layout with a heading, a paragraph, and a button. When the button is clicked, the text in the paragraph is changed using JavaScript.

To create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will need to write the HTML code to structure the content of the website, the CSS code to style the website, and the JavaScript code to add interactivity to the website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
